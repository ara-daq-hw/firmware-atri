HEADER Event interface, version 2.
HEADER
HEADER This interface describes a FIFO connection from the IRS
HEADER to the PHY. The FIFO is 16-bits, and asynchronous (independent
HEADER clocks on both sides) and contains a data count to the IRS.
HEADER
HEADER Unlike the previous versions, this version only connects the
HEADER IRS to the FIFO. It does not connect the readout logic
HEADER to the FIFO as well: the FIFO is presumed to be in the PHY
HEADER logic.
